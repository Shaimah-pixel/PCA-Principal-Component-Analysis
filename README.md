This dataset is designed for predicting energy consumption based on various building features and environmental factors. 
It contains data for multiple building types, square footage, the number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature, and the day of the week. 

The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate energy consumption using these attributes.

Conclusion:
The value of 0.845 which comes from a linear regression model likely represents the R-squared (RÂ²) value, which indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (data_y) that is explained by the independent variables (data_x_pca1_df).
In this case, an R-squared value of 0.845 means that approximately 84.5% of the variability in data_y can be explained by the linear relationship with the predictors (the columns of data_x_pca1_df).
